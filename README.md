# Droploris.GetProxies

#What is this tool?
This tool helps you getting many proxies from active proxy lists in just a couple seconds.

#Why would I need this?
For basically every purpose you might need a proxy for. This just simplifies the act of getting many proxies.

#Do all of the gained proxies work?
No, it is very unlikely that every single one will work. Currently there is no proxy checker implemented, this may or may not be added in the future.
